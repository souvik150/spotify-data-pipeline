# Spotify Data Pipeline

* Developed a data pipeline using AWS Lambda, S3, Glue Crawler, and Athena for real-time Spotify data ingestion,
transformation, and querying.
* Replaced AWS Lambda with AWS Glue ETL and Apache Spark for more efficient transformations and orchestrated the
entire pipeline with Apache Airflow for automation.
